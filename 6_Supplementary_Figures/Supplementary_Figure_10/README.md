### 1_v2_YS_IPSC_mac_lin_A1_V7_IG_logist_general_060321_low_dim_regression.ipynb
Code used to generate:
Heatmap of class prediction probabilities for a logistic regression model (Elasticnet) trained on YS scRNA-seq myeloid cell states (x-axis) projected onto equivalent cell states in iPSC scRNA-seq data (y-axis), where the iPSC system was optimized for macrophage production (20).‘Monocyte1’ and ‘Monocyte2’ are grouped into the ‘Monocyte’ category (table S13). Color scale indicates median probabilities.


### 2_A1_V5_cellrank_HSPC_transition_probability.ipynb
Code used to generate: Cellrank-derived probabilistic lineage transition model featuring iPSC derived  HSPCs  and transition probability to terminal macro states. 


### 3_iPSC_macrophage_trajectories.ipynb
Code used to generate: Density plots showing the distribution of transitioning iPSC-derived scRNA-seq (20) HSPCs and macrophage lineage cells from <D21 (n= 5; k=779) (left) and >D23 (n=7; k=8,553) (right) in the integrated FDG embedding from Fig. 5, G. Color of cells represents the z-scored kernel density estimation (KDE) score for each timepoint (table S7, S5). (D) Left: Stacked bar plot displaying the percent of monocytes, pre-macrophages and macrophages found in iPSC cultures (20) by day. Right: Stacked bar plot displaying the proportion of cell states found in iPSC cultures by day.
