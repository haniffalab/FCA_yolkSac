### 1_AEC-HE_HSPC_trajectories.ipynb
Code used to generate: FDG overlaid with PAGA showing trajectory of HE transition to HSPC in YS scRNA-seq dataset (n=3, k=2262) (left) and feature plots of key genes (IL33, ALDH1A1, GFI1) involved in endothelial to hemogenic transition (right) (Supplementary Table 27). i. Stills of 3D (left) and 2D z-stack (right) light-sheet fluorescence microscopy images of a 7PCW YS stained with LYVE1 and PLVAP (top). Scale bar=700um; see

### 2_YS_CPDB_interactions_across_time.ipynb
Code used to generate: Heatmap showing curated and statistically significant (P<0.05) CellphoneDB-predicted interactions between YS HSPCs and stromal cells that change across gestational age. Color scale indicates relative mean expression z-scores. (F) Schematic of selected and statistically significant (P<0.05) CellphoneDB-predicted interactions between YS HSPCs and endoderm, fibroblasts (Fib), smooth muscle cells (SMC), or endothelial cells (EC) derived from scRNA- seq data. Interactions are grouped by predicted receptor to ECM interactions, ligandâ€“receptor interactions, and surface-bound ligand-receptor interactions. Receptors and ligands in italics significantly decrease at CS17-23 (6-8PCW). See Materials and Methods and tables S28 and 29.

### 3_A1_V5_cellrank_HSPC_transition_probability.ipynb
Code used to determine probability of transition for each curated terminal state in the YS, used to guide robust trajectory inference between AEC to HSPCs. Output description: Force directed graph overlaid with partition-based approximate graph abstraction (PAGA) map showing the trajectory of hemogenic endothelium (HE) transition to HSPC in definitive iPSC scRNA-seq data (12) (n=3, k=2,262) with feature plots of key genes (IL33, ALDH1A1) involved in endothelial to hemogenic transition (table S5). Feature plots of key genes in endothelial to hemogenic transition (SPINK2, KCNK17) in YS, iPSC and definitive iPSCs scRNA-seq trajectories (also shown in Fig. 4, C).
