## Pipeline for cross specieis probabillistic label transfer based on gene-gene sequence homology BLAST

### 1) cross species BLAST
Ipython notebook which downloads and runs BLAST

### 2) Cross species SAMAP
- Pipeline which uses the SAMAP algorythym (Tarashansky, Alexander J., et al) to create a common graph embedding between Human and mouse data. 
- Pipeline applies probabillistic label transfer on the joint PC space $\hat{P}_i$ using the method described in generalised logistic regression pipeline
